# DevCamp
These guide will help instructors when delivering this course. There are some speaker notes in each deck, but this will provide a broader view of how the course was put together.

The Developer bootcamp is a collection of lectures, content and hands on labs that is intended to provide developers with a jumpstart to Azure development. There is an emphasis on the Platform as a Services (PAAS) offerings in Azure but there are some IaaS related topics as well.

The concept of "1-app, 3 ways" was born from the idea that developers want to see the whole picture, not just pieces. In previous training courses, they are focused on individual modules and learning objectives. For this bootcamp, we took the approach of a single application and functionality is added over the 2 days (Develop, deploy, monitor, scale). We also realized that developers may want to see the same functionality developed in different languages, so they can compare and contrast approaches.

The application is very simple; a CRUD based form with as few moving parts as possible, all while being industry/vertical agnostic. The application can be re-imagined in several ways with minimal impact to the session content and HOLs.
* Education - A science fair idea board
* Manufacturing - Process improvement
* E-Commerce - Item review/feedback


## Getting prepared to deliver ##
* It is recommended that the instructor works through the Hands-On-Labs for all three languages before the session.  Each one will take 
approximately 3 hours, and will help you be ready to assist the attendees with any issues or language-specific questions.  The hands-on-labs are
all done in the cloud, so all that is required for this part of the preparation is a laptop or workstation that can run Remote Desktop and access the
Internet.

* Azure subscription: 
    To run the demos and perform the hands-on-labs, an Azure subscription is necessary.  You can sign up for a free trial (as the students do in the first lab), or you can use a paid subscription.  Keep in mind that all the resources deployed for the hands-on-labs consume approx $10 of resources per day, so you will want to shut down virtual machines, etc. when not in use.

    Install the DevCamp Resource Group template, and deploy one of the `end` applications to one of the App services. 

    The application depends on a series of Environment Variables to be set. As a jumpstart, the ARM Template's Outputs section provides individual variables and an all-up object with all variables related to the services that were provisioned.  Note that you may need to add variables specific to the labs, such as AzureAD information, in addition to the ARM Template related variables provided.

    Set up monitoring in AppInsights, so there will be some monitoring data by the time you show this feature

    Create an OMS portal - you can set up a trial here: `https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite-trial`

* Workstation configuration: 
    You can either use your local laptop/workstation for development and demo tasks, or you can use a Virtual Machine in 
    Azure. These instructions will assume using the local laptop running Windows 10 Anniversary edition. This will allow 
    you to show bash on Windows.
    1. You will need PowerPoint installed to show the presentation slides. If you don't have PowerPoint, you can
    use the free PowerPoint viewer available here: `https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13`

    1. Install `Windows Subsystem for Linux`, which supplies the bash command processor on windows.  
    Go to `control panel/software/Turn Windows Features on or off`, and select `Windows Subsystem for Linux`:

        ![image](./media/2016-10-28_14-51-30.png)

    1. Install Visual Studio community edition from here: `https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/`.

        ![image](./media/2016-10-28_14-58-13.png)

    1. Install Azure Storage Explorer from `http://storageexplorer.com`.  Connect it to your azure subscription so you can show Azure Blobs and queues.

    1. Prep Docker demo
        * On Windows
            * Make sure you have the Anniversary edition
            * Activate the containers feature in Windows
            * Download [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) from the stable channel

## Module 1 - Tools and Developer Environment Setup Overview ####
We will provide an overview of the developer tools available for developing on your platform, and set up the development resources for the DevCamp.

[View PowerPoint](Presentation/Module01-DevTools.pptx?raw=true)

**Goal:** Provides an overview into the different development approaches, introduction to the SDKs, tools and frameworks for cross platform development.

**Possible demos:** 
* Demo 1: Visual Studio and Azure
    1. show ARM template
    1. create a simple MVC application, show the Azure publishing wizard
    1. show cloud explorer
    1. show git integration

* Demo 2: Azure CLI (on Windows 10 Bash, but it is also available on Docker, Linux/OSX etc.)
    Start Azure CLI, here are some commands you can show
    ```CMD
    azure config mode ARM
    azure login
    azure location list
    azure group list
    azure group show DevCamp
    azure vm list
    azure vm start
    ```

**Session prep tips:** 
    Have visual studio ready with an ARM template and template MVC web app

**Key takeaways:**  
* There are lots of tools for making development in Azure easier.  Also, we don't force you to use our tools - you can use the technologies that you like.

**Common questions:** 
* Can I do development on my local machine?  Of course, we're just using an Azure based machine for convenience and consistency.  If you would like to install the development components on your machine, that is fine.

**Watch out for:** 
* Make sure all attendee development environments are set up


### HOL Proctoring ###
* Potential subscription setup issues - order of steps is important
* If there are problems, we can use the azure passes we've allocated
* If the attendee wants to use their own Azure subscription, that's ok but be aware of potential issues with O365 integration (they must be a Global Admin)

**Tasks to complete**
* Set up development environment

**Exit criteria**
* It can take up to 20 minutes or more to deploy the resource group for development.

**Possible issues**
* No cell phone and/or Credit card for verification - these are required for trial subscriptions.  If the attendee doesn't have them, let them use one of the Azure Passes.
* If trials have already been created using that phone or credit card, the process may fail.  If so, give them an azure pass. 
* If they have an existing subscription they'd like to use, that's fine but there may be issues with connectivity to O365.

**If you have an issue setting the Azure Pass or trial, but some students are working, have that user set up a new user(s) account. Make the test user accounts Global Admin. Also grant the user account access to Azure to the subscription.**

> The ARM Template may not deploy successfully in all regions due to a lack of CosmosDB or a VM Size deployed in that region. As of 5 Jan 2017 the following regions will fail: westindia. Please have attendees select one of the other Azure regions.
